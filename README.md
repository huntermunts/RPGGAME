Hunter and Elias' game project

## Description

Top-down bullet-hell RPG with combos, magic, weapons, relics, unique characters and monsters. Based in rural Laplacia there are forests, plains, mountains, lakes, towns and caves to explore. A pharma company is fighting a pandemic that is sweeping the nation and figured out how to supersize microorganisms and are weaponizing them against undesireables who have contracted the disease. The company can easily supersize single-celled organisms without mutations and are small and agile but complex microorganisms need more research to reduce the side effects of supersizing like a 25% chance of rabies.
